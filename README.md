# Blog Post Airbnb Seattle
### Writing a Data Science blog post for Udacity DSND project 

### Overview
This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree course. This repository includes the python codes to answer three questions about Airbnb Seattle following the CRISP-DM process in Data Mining. 

### Data Content
The Seattle AirBnB data can be find in Kaggle. There are 3 differnt csv data files:
1) Listings, including full descriptions and average review score  
2) Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments  
3) Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

### Motivation 
For this project, I was intersected in answering the following questions:
1) Which AirBnB listing is more profitable?
2) Based on the listings' features what are the price rates?
3) Forcast the price rates for future months?

### File Description
These 3 questions are analyzed and answered through 3 different notebooks respectively. Each file includes data preprocessing, data formatting, visualization, descriptive statistics and predictive analysis. But the focus of this study was to follow CRISP-DM process and communicate the result throng a blog post than developing the best predictive solution. 

### Results
As mentined before, the result and findings are communicated through a blog posted on Medium and can be find here.

### Acknowledgement
Must give credit to Udacity awesome Data Science course for some of code ideas, and to Kaggle for the data. The data is posted here. Please feel free to use these codes and develop them if you are interested.
